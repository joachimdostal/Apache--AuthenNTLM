	- Finally added Lupe Christoph's <lupe@alanya.m.isar.de> patches to

0.7  Mon Apr 19 19:22:13 1999

0.8  Mon Apr 19 19:37:13 1999
        - Shot another smbval bug.

0.81  Sun Jun  6 10:2:09 1999
	- Updated to the latest smbval library, hopefully resolving some
	  segfaults and authentication problems for usernames and passwords
	  with weird characters in them.
	- Cleaned up Smb.xs
	- Unreleased version

0.9  Sun Jun  6 18:50:23 1999
	- While toying around with smbval, discovered some buffer overflows
	  in the library.  Worked around them in the perl portion of the
	  module for now, but will get in touch with author to try and
	  merge some patches to resolve the overflows in the library itself.
	  Because of these overflows, it is _critical_ that anyone using
	  Authen::Smb, including those using Apache::AuthenSmb, upgrade to
	  0.9.  I have not spent a lot of time investigating the overflows,
	  but I believe them to be exploitable.

0.91 Mon Jun  7 08:03:47 1999
	- Fixed a ridiculous thinko in Smb.pm (thansk Daniel Myers)

0.93-0.96 Seg 3 2002

      fixed bug in nonce passing
