     smb auth to fail randomly

0.20  27. Aug 2002
   
   - Directly close connection to smb server after validation 

0.19  26. Aug 2002

   - Fixed in smbval c library to allow multiple connections at the same
     time (i.e. set VcNumber to 1 instead of 0)
   - Rewored serialziation code. It now makes sure that the whole
     request to the smb server is serialzied.
   - Added semtimeout directive to avoid endless locks.
   - Debug messages cleanup. Now can set ntlmdebug to 1 or 2 to
     get less/more verbose infomations.

0.18  23. Aug 2002

   - Update smbval library
   - Fixed problem with guest access. Before 0.18 smbval lib would
     logon any user if the domain contains a guest account.
     Patch from Eric Devolder.
   - Fixed problem that smbval lib cannot handle two requests at
     the same time. I don't know if this is a general problem
     of the smb protocol, but after doing a lot of research
     the only solution I found is to serialzie all requests
     to the server. See also PerlSetVar ntlmsemkey.
   - Added fallbackdomain which is used when the domain the user
     supplied is not configured. Patch from David B. Pasirstein.
   - Fixed missing headers for Basic Auth. Patch from  David B. Pasirstein.
   - Make username always lowercase in connection record, to avoid
     problems when comparing user name (e.g. in q require directive)

     for another authorization method given from the browser.
   - Log the connection header in debug mode to see if it's a keep
     alive request.

 0.15  9. Apr 2002

   - Added patch from Brian Paulsen which causes correct handling of
     non unicode charset (needed for some versions of win9x) and
     more verbose debugging output (decoded flags)
